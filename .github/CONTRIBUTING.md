# 💌 Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! We're excited to collaborate with you and appreciate the effort you put into improving the project. Whether you're a developer, bug hunter, typo detective, or documentation wizard, your contributions make this project stronger.

Below are some guidelines and best practices to help you get started and ensure your contributions are effective and aligned with the project's goals.

## 📝 How Can You Contribute?

There are many ways you can contribute to the project. Here are some common types of contributions:

### 1. **🐛 Bug Hunter**

If you find a bug or unexpected behavior in the code, we encourage you to report it. Here’s how you can contribute:

- **Identify the Bug**: Try to reproduce the issue and provide as much detail as possible.
- **Submit an Issue**: If it’s a new bug, create an issue using the issue templates to help us understand the problem.
- **Fix the Bug**: If you have the skills, feel free to fix the bug yourself and open a pull request (PR).

### 2. **✏️ Typo Hunter**

Typos can sometimes be overlooked, but they can affect the overall quality and readability of the project. Here’s how you can help:

- **Check the Code**: Review code comments, documentation, and variable names for typos or grammatical errors.
- **Submit Fixes**: Open a pull request (PR) with your fixes for any typos you find.

### 3. **💡 Feature Requests**

Got an idea for a new feature? We love hearing new ideas! Here’s how to contribute:

- **Suggest Features**: Open an issue to suggest new features or improvements. Be as detailed as possible and explain why the feature would benefit the project.
- **Implement Features**: If you’re able to, implement the feature and open a pull request with your changes. Make sure the feature aligns with the project’s goals and existing architecture.

### 4. **📄 Documentation Contributor**

Good documentation makes the project accessible to everyone. If you find anything unclear or missing, here’s how you can help:

- **Fix Errors**: Correct any factual or grammatical errors you find in the documentation.
- **Enhance Content**: Expand on existing documentation or add new sections that are missing.
- **Improve Clarity**: Ensure the documentation is easy to follow, and rephrase any complex or ambiguous sections.
- **Examples**: If you think the documentation would benefit from examples, feel free to add them to clarify the use of the project.

### 5. **👨‍💻 Developer Contributions**

If you're ready to dive into the code, here's how you can contribute:

- **Code Improvements**: Refactor code, improve performance, or address technical debt. If you spot areas where the code can be more efficient or readable, feel free to make those changes.
- **Bug Fixes**: Tackle open bugs by investigating the issue, finding a solution, and submitting a pull request.
- **New Features**: Add new features or enhance existing ones. Ensure that new functionality aligns with the overall vision of the project.

## 👨‍💻 Code Style and Best Practices

We adhere to certain coding standards to maintain a clean and readable codebase. Here are the key guidelines you should follow:

### 1. **Clean Code**

- **Meaningful Names**: Choose descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes. Your code should be self-explanatory.
- **Avoid Code Duplication**: Strive for DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code. If you find duplicate logic, consider refactoring.
- **Commenting**: Write comments for complex logic or sections of code that are not immediately obvious. However, avoid over-commenting—good code should be clear enough to need minimal explanation.

### 2. **Test Coverage**

- **Write Tests**: If you’re adding new functionality or fixing a bug, please ensure you add or update tests to cover the changes. This helps maintain the stability of the project.
- **Run Tests**: Before submitting your PR, make sure all tests pass. We rely on automated testing to verify that contributions don’t break anything.

## 📝 Writing Issues

When creating issues, providing detailed and clear information will help us resolve them faster. Here’s how you can help us:

### 1. **Use the Issue Templates**

- We have several templates for different types of issues (e.g., bug reports, feature requests). Using these templates ensures consistency and helps you provide the necessary details.
- If none of the templates fit your issue, feel free to create your own, but try to include the following information:
    - **Description of the Problem**: What is the issue? Be as specific as possible.
    - **Steps to Reproduce**: If it’s a bug, describe the steps needed to reproduce the issue.
    - **Expected vs. Actual Behavior**: What should happen, and what is happening instead?
    - **Environment**: Specify the environment where the issue occurs (e.g., operating system, version of dependencies).
    - **Screenshots/Logs**: If applicable, attach any relevant screenshots, error logs, or output.

### 2. **Feature Requests**

- If you want to request a new feature, please follow these guidelines:
    - **Clearly Describe the Feature**: What would this feature do, and why is it valuable to the project?
    - **Examples**: Provide examples or use cases that demonstrate how this feature would be used.
    - **Avoid Duplication**: Search existing issues to see if the feature has already been suggested.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 How to Submit Your Contribution

Ready to submit your changes? Here’s a step-by-step guide to submitting your contribution:

2. **Clone Your Fork**: Clone your fork to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/wrong-lang/manao.git`.
3. **Create a New Branch**: Before making changes, create a new branch. A good naming convention is to use `feature/your-feature-name` or `bugfix/your-bugfix-name`.
4. **Make Your Changes**: Implement your changes or fixes. Be sure to follow the code style and formatting guidelines.
5. **Test Your Changes**: Run any relevant tests to ensure your changes work as expected and don’t break anything.
6. **Commit Your Changes**: Write a clear and concise commit message describing the changes you’ve made. For example: `Fix bug in user authentication flow` or `Add new feature for exporting reports`.
7. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your changes to your fork using `git push origin your-branch-name`.
8. **Open a Pull Request**: Navigate to the main repository and open a pull request (PR). Make sure to select your branch and provide a detailed description of your changes.
