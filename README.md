## 🤔 About

This project includes a Twitch chatbot and some overlays used in my Twitch channel (tinarskii). Inspired
by [thananon/twitch_tools](https://github.com/thananon/twitch_tools)
and [lucidkarn/luciabot](https://github.com/lucidkarn/luciabot).
The project is written in TypeScript and uses Bun instead of Node.js, many features may be unavailable or not working as
expected if you are not using Bun.

## 🙋‍♂️ FAQ

### How do I get my Twitch API credentials?

You can get your Twitch API credentials by creating a **new application** (not extensions) in
the [Twitch Developer Portal](https://dev.twitch.tv/). Set "OAuth Redirect URL" to `http://localhost:3000/`, set the category
to "Chat Bot" and client type to "Confidential". After that, you will be redirected to the application page.
Get your client ID and client secret from the application's dashboard, and add them to your `.env` file.
After that, you can install [TwitchCLI](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/cli/) and run the following command to get your
access token:

```sh
twitch token -u -s "user:edit user:read:email chat:read chat:edit channel:moderate moderation:read moderator:manage:shoutouts moderator:manage:announcements channel:manage:moderators channel:manage:broadcast channel:read:vips channel:read:subscriptions channel:manage:vips channel:read:redemptions channel:manage:redemptions moderator:read:followers bits:read"
```

You will receive a user access token and a refresh token, add them to your `.env` file.
**Note:** You should run the following command 2 times, once for the bot account and once for the broadcaster account, make sure
to logout of Twitch before running the command again. Put the access token and refresh token in the `.env` file accordingly.

### I couldn't install Bun in my system

_~~Currently, Bun is only available for Linux and MacOS. If you are using Windows, you can use WSL or a virtual machine to
run the project.~~_
**Bun is now available for Windows**, you can follow the [official documentation](https://bun.sh/docs/installation/windows)
for the installation.
For further assistance about installing Bun, you may ask in the [Bun official Discord server](https://bun.sh/discord).

### How do I add the overlays to my stream?

You can add the overlays to your stream by adding a new browser source in your streaming software (OBS, Streamlabs, etc.).
You can copy the URL of the overlay you want to add and paste it in the URL field of the browser source.
For music source, to interact with the player, find the "Interact" button. From there, you can set the YouTube Player 
volume and interact with the music player. You can also pause the video, it won't interrupt with the music player functions.
If you want to skip the song manually, drag the time slider to the end of the video.

The URLs of the overlays are as follows (assuming you are running the bot locally):
- Chat Overlay: `http://localhost:3000/overlays/chat`
- Event Feed: `http://localhost:3000/overlays/events`
- Music Player: `http://localhost:3000/overlays/music`
- Soundboard Player: `http://localhost:3000/soundboard/player`

### How do I change the bot's prefix?

You can change the bot's prefix by modifying the `PREFIX` variable in the `src/config.ts` file.

### Will there be another language support?

No, not at the moment. However, if you want to help with translations, feel free to open a pull request.

### I have a question that is not listed here / A problem with the bot
